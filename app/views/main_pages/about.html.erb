<h1> About Hunter Jansen </h1>
<p>Hunter Jansen is a 4th semester computer programming and analysis student studying at <%= link_to "Seneca College", "http://www.senecac.on.ca/" %> in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After persuing a career in theatre performance, he decided that after his life long passion of all things computing, perhaps that is where his interests would be best served.</p>
<p>During the Summer of 2012, Hunter worked as a coop for NexJ Systems Inc. as a Network Application Specialist, where he would create helpful scripts and front end web interfaces for those scripts to interact with. While there he used many languages, but focused primarily on PHP, JavaScript, ASP.net, and C# while honing his CSS skill.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2012, Hunter will be moving on to a new coop position as a Junior Software Developer for MCW consulting where he'll be doing even more web development and dipping his toes into the world of iOS development.</p>
<p>In his spare time, Hunter self teaches Ruby on Rails, Android Development and Java.</p>
<h2> About syntaxSymposium </h2>
<p>In his spare time he began to create syntaxSymposium. It began on Wordpress.com, but he quickly found that he didn't have the level of control that he desired. So, syntaxSymposium went on a brief stint at <%= link_to "SquareSpace.com", "http://www.squarespace.com/"%>. While Hunter greatly loves everything about SquareSpace, after he discovered they didn't support java applets being run on their page, he needed to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, he decided to purchase his own domain space and run the wordpress software off of there. The experience was much better than wordpress.com, but no matter how much he tinkered with it, it just never felt like his. That was when he decided to build everything from the ground up. But what language to use?</p>
<p>That summer he had been hearing a lot more about <%= link_to "Ruby On Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org/" %> and decided that he would take the extreme journey in teaching himself. The new syntaxSymposium is the brain child of those labours. Constantly growing and changing, Hunter spends his scant spare time learning how better to make syntaxSymposium his home on the web and would love it if you would too.</p>
